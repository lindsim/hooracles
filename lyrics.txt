My Baby went to Africa

With the dirty lens photographer

My Baby stayin' in jungle land

With a U S body and a real light tan

My Baby went to Africa

With a make-up man and his love-sick lover

She get a couple o' grand and a two-piece suit

Let the folks back home see the native beauty

My Baby went to Africa

Gotta pack my bags and get to her

Before the lions and tigers try to jump on her bones

Baby - baby - babySkin tight soul delight

Changing her life for another

She dreams magazines

Sees herself on the cover

Anything anytime anywhere

It's fitting in that matters

Faithfully she believes in the look he wants to know better

She knows what she wants

She's an all American girl

She knows what she needs

She's a sold American girl

She knows what she knows

She's an all American girl

She does what she does

She's an all American girl

Sold American

She's got a Double Bubble with a bossanova back

She's a real hot pepper and I like it like that

It's all right you don't have to change your way

You're all right I'm hoping the best part stays

She knows what she wants

She's an all American girl

She knows what she needs

She's a sold American girl

She knows what she knows

She's an all American girl

She does what she does

She's an all American girl

Sold American

Street smart close to the heart gotta be real

More than the clothes you wear

You know what you've got look to your heart

You carry your history there
I can see the anger

and I surely feel

All the passion, baby gone astray

Why are we divided

so dissatisfied

Does it matter what we do or say

I can't see the wisdom

Never gonna give in

When the love is not so far away

I was hoping for more

I’m still hoping for sure

Isn't anybody dreamin'

Isn’t anybody thinking

Or am I all by myself

Isn't anybody teachin'

Why is everybody preachin’

Am I all by myself

Don't you feel it lately

That you're the only one

Who can see through bitter lies right here

Like everybody knows it

But no one seems to care

As if there's something in the truth we fear

Aren't you hoping for more

I'm still hoping for sure

Isn’t anybody dreamin'

Isn’t anybody thinking

And all by myself

Isn’t anybody lovin’

Isn’t anybody huggin’

Am I all by myself, tell me, tell me

Am I all by myself

All by myself

Come on everybody teach it with me

Am I all by myself

Don’t wanna be all by myself

Come on everybody preach it with me

All You Want Is Heaven
 
"Calling All Good People"
heard a voice as I walked by
from the shadows lost among us
a madman caught my eye

Like an island on the corner
with his posters and his signs
but today I stopped to listen to his words
that spilled like wine

All Good People
free and chained
All Good People
those unnamed
All Good People
who's to blame
'cause it's a hard world

Calling All Good People
weak and strong
All Good People
keep holding on
rise into the light
and change this hard world
Calling Calling Calling All Good People

Though I kept on walking his words
echoed in the air
and a message filled the madness
I looked back
he was not there
Calling All Good People
Why don't you pack I'll take you back
Just a little boy lost looking for a lamb in the all night city

Living in his lonely limousine

And though he never has to worry

He's the only one and only one he's ever gonna need

Absolutely he's in definite need

Of a woman, child, and some better kind of love when the hot town's hurt him

And he knows how happy he could be

But he don't know if he can make it

Between the money and another lonely night

But now the time has come

Got to stay or run

Now the time has come

Oh maybe we've been Alone Too Long

And you don't want to be lonely

Another pretty face another body ache still awake three-thirty

Dial another number -- No one home

So he wastes his time with TV

And he wonders if he lost the only one

And wonders if he's free

Too afraid to see

How alone he could be

Oh maybe we've been Alone Too Long

And you don't want to be lonely
I saw the sun, though it didn't shine

Gave up no shadows, gave out no way to know the time

No wind to blow the silver leaves

The drone of clever talk just stopped

The air hangs out, hesitates to carry a thought

Away from me

And the sky colored heavy gray

August Day

Stir the dust and carve a rhyme

Barefoot blues watch and wait till suppertime

Will a smile break through

Distant thunder and the slow dance

Static lightning sky daring me to take a chance

And say that I love you

And the sky colored heavy gray

August Day
Babs and Babs lay dreaming in a four poster bed

Arm in arm, head to head, Babs and Babs

Babs said, "Whatcha thinking?"

She said, "Nothing

But I never do 'cause I leave it up to you"

Babs looked out the window

Saw the moon and the sky

She saw the clouds drifting by

Voices crying and sighing and dying but she said nothing

"Look out on the lawn, there's a moon out tonight

There's a moon out tonight, can'tcha see?"

"Silver dreams don't move me or your talk of the stars

And this isn't the time or place to make a fool of me.

No one wants to hear you when you're slipping away

And the light of your day always shows up the strength of your vision."

But she said nothing.

So Babs said "Don't you worry, I'll take good care of you

You're lack of feeling's a rotten thing

But I'll show you what to do.

Girl, you've got to get away

Girl, you've got to feel, oh, yeah."

Babs said "Don't you patronize me, I'm fine the way I am

At least I know what's happening

And I know just where I stand.

You live alone you die alone

When your dreams all fade away, oh, yeah."

Never compromising, never see eye to eye

So they turn, with a sigh, Babs and Babs

Have to be together like the night and the day

So they might as well stay the best of friends.

Locked in love we leave them with the moon in the sky

With the clouds drifting by

Voices crying and sighing and dying and we say nothing
Never let nobody know me
Never let nobody dare
Never let somebody hold me
Long enough for me to care...
Till I found you
Till I found you.

Never let my guard down easy
Never let myself let go
I never knew the reason why
I never let my feelings show
Till I felt the pain
Of loving you

And that's what hurts
When we say goodbye
And that's what hurts
On those sleepless nights
There's nothing I can do
Cos I'm lost inside of you
And that's what hurts.

I never let nobody touch me
Never let nobody try
I never let somebody move me
Deep enough to make me cry
Till I found you
Till I found you
Just look at you and me

Yea we've had some fun,

don't you agree?

Now that we have come this far

Time to stop the game and

make a start

I want you to take this seriously

But all you do is show inhumanity

You hurt me oh, but I can't

hurt you back

Baby don't you know I've got more

heart than that

I can't hide the way I feel

Help me please, baby please help me

We've reached the borderline

Nowhere to go but down

If we can't turn our world around

We've reached the borderline

Maybe it's not too late

Only we can choose our fate

I tried but I can't loose the crazy pain

I wish that it would go so I can live again

You may or may not know That I'm

beside myself

Oh you know there's only you and

no one else

I can't hide, it's sad you see

Something that could feel so good

may never be

We've reached the borderline

Nowhere to go but down

If we can't turn our world around

We've reached the borderline

Got everything to gain

If only we can stop the pain

The sky is falling

Falling again

Keep on reaching

Keep believing
I was strong and independent
I Never needed anyone
I thought I had it all together
Until you came and proved me wrong
Now I'm stronger with you
In my life

And that's what hurts
When we say goodbye
And that's what hurts
On those sleepless nights
There's nothing I can do
Cos I'm lost inside of you
And that's what hurts
Yeah and that's the catch
But the hearts not good at holding back
It's a blessing and a curse
And I don't know what's worse
And that's what hurts.

Sometimes I wanna run
Sometimes I feel just like a fool
Sometimes I'm even sorry baby
That I felt in love with you.
Oooh that's when it hurts
It hurts so bad
Ooh can't sleep at night
Nothing I can do
Cause I'm lost inside of you
Oohhh
It hurts oh it hurts
Cause I'm lost inside of you
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Hurts without you baby
You're not here, you're not here 
She said nothing
Nothing left to say
I used to wake up every day
Thinkin' back
On what I should've said
I put my trust
In a rifle full of rust
And the holding of it
Had to turn my hands red

Thought I'd never
Cross my heart with another
Up until the time
I met you yesterday
Then oh my, I thought I would die
But I'm back in love again

Forget about the time
And the faith I left behind
Sad to say my luck went wrong
I made a plan
For a castle made from sand
But you can't build close
To where the tide comes rollin'

I thought I'd never
Cross my heart with another
Up until the time
I saw you, mama, yesterday
Then oh my, I thought I would die
But I'm back in love again
Said oh my, I thought I would die
But I'm back in love again
Ooh, I'm back in love again
Oh, I'm back in love again
Can we sing a truly good song
we should sing now you and I
For the children who live without music
in the land where songs have all died
They need food for empty bodies
we need love to fill our souls
They are small and dark and distant
we are big enough to know

Oh is it all that real
we see with our own eyes but it's so hard to feel

If for us the sun is shining
They have one long evening star
See the pictures in our papers
and we watch the pictures starve

Oh is it all that real
we see with our own eyes but it's so hard to feel

So can we sing a truly good song
we should sing now you and I
For the children who live without music
in the land where songs have all died

la la la...

Oh is it all that real
We breathe enough to live but it's so hard to feel
to the countryside

Now's the time

I've got a little place in mind.

We don't need no neighbors making noise at night,

dogs that fight

You'll sleep like a child,

the city steaming miles away.

Never thought you'd see the good life

Let me tell you how it feels

We can let our hearts be open, wide,

so all our love will come through.

Up and gone, we'll be moving on

when the morning comes

This is the way,

I heard that it's supposed to be.

I can almost see the flowers growing there

taste the air

We've waited awhile,

I never thought we'd see the day.
What's the point of standing

ten feet tall if you never learn to fall

If you want to win you've got to play the game

but if you lose you must accept the pain

so don't reach for the sky if

All you want is heaven.

Reason makes us human

but love makes us believe we can conquer all

I ask for fire and you give me rain

I ask for nothing and you give the same

and I'd give you the sky but

All you want is heaven.
70's Scenario
 

In bed sittin' and reading by the T. V. light

Stay away from the window, thunder and lighting

And the rain, the rain keeps fallin' down

That's something that hasn't changed

Yeah, there's something inside me, it's quiet when it rains

At the end of the rainbow, there ain't no pot of gold

And the light in the morning, hardly ever shows

Ain't no easy living, everybody knows

And it's all around us........
They sat in an Abandoned Luncheonette

sipping imaginary cola and drawing faces in the tabletop dust

His voice was rusty from years as a sergeant on "this man's army"

they were old and crusty

She was twenty when the diner was a baby

He was the dishwasher, busy in the back, his hands covered with

gravy

Hair black and wavy

Brilliantine slick, a pot - cleaning dandy,

He was young and randy

Day to day, to day... today

then they were old, their lives wasted away

Month to month, year to year

they all run together

time measured by the peeling of paint on the luncheonette wall

They sat together in the empty diner

filled with cracked china

Old news was blowing across the filthy floor

and the sign on the door read "this way out", that's all it read

that's all it said
70's Scenario

She called me a prisoner, in a prison of the mass

She said acceptance from the future, is freedom from the past

and I laugh, and say "that's alright"

Things really ain't that tough

As long as I'm still able, to turn the T.V. off

At the end of the rainbow, there ain't no pot of gold

And the light in the morning, hardly ever shows

Ain't no reason living, everybody knows

And it's all around us........

Big Kids
 

Got a good education now

And I'm ready for the world (yeah)

We've been going together

It's gonna last forever, it ain't never gonna change

I'm a real hard charger (yeah)

Everybody's gonna listen to me

We're a winning combination, that nobody's gonna rearrange

Big Kids breakin' up 'cause they're lookin' for fun

Everybody's leavin', boy-girl on the run

My situation's static, there's no reason to fear

It's too calm around me and it can't happen here

Big Kids - think they know it all

Big Kids - think they've got the world up against the wall

All the grown-ups show me that they're only Big Kids in disguise

Who do you think your leaders are? Big Kids

Who do you think your heros are? Big Kids

I may never reach maturity but, baby, I'm gonna try
A Lot Of Changes Coming
 

Now Jimmy was livin' in misery
The poor boy was livin' in sin
When Jesus gave his life on Calvary
It weren't to save Jimmy's skin
He didn't play by any rules
But one thing he knew for sure

There were a lot of changes comin'
He'd best be payin' them some mind
There were a lot of changes comin'
He knew he'd better take his time

Jehovah sent a bright light shinin' down
Knocked Jimmy to the floor
He knew the message well enough
He'd heard it all said before
The reverend told Jimmy when he was a boy
The preacher when he was a man

There were a lot of changes comin'
He'd best be payin' them some mind
There were a lot of changes comin'
You know you better take your time

Jimmy went to mountain top
He's livin' with the trees
He listened to the world as it grow
Remebers all he sees
He ain't a saint or a prophet, no
But one thing he knows for sure

There were a lot of changes comin'
You've best be payin' them some mind
Now there were a lot of changes comin'
You know you better take your time



You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips 

And there's no tenderness like before in your finger tips 

You're trying hard not to show it (baby) 

But baby, baby I know it 

You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling 

Oh that Lovin' Feeling 

You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling 

Now it's gone gone gone oh oh oh 

 

There's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you 

And girl you're starting to criticize little things I do 

Ooh, it makes me just feel like crying (baby)

'Cause baby something beautiful's dying

You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling 

Oh that Lovin' Feeling 

You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling 

Not it's gone gone gone oh oh oh 

 

Baby baby I get down on my knees for you

(Get down on my knees) 

If you would only love me like you used to

(If you would only love me love me) 

We had a love, a love that you don't find everyday 

(A love you don't find) 

So don't don't don't let it slip away (away) 

I said baby Baby Baby Baby 

(I'm beggin you please)

 I'm begging you please I need your love 

(I need your love) 

I need your love 

So bring it on back (bring it on back) 

Now bring it on back 

Now bring it on back 

You've got to bring back that lovin' feeling

Oh that lovin' feeling 

Bring back that lovin' feeling 'cause it's gone gone gone 

And I can't go on oh oh oh 

Bring back that lovin' feeling 

Oh that lovin' feeling 

Bring back that lovin' feeling 'cause it's gone gone gone 

Bring back that lovin' feeling 

Oh that lovin' feeling 

Bring back that lovin' feeling 'cause it's gone gone gone 

Bring back that lovin' feeling 

Oh that lovin' feeling 
Too much time is wasted on the world

Too much time is wasted on you, girl

Indifferent or cold

A dragged-up scene from an old dream

Does it surprise you where those feelings can go?

Too much power is wasted on the wrong words

Too much power is wasted on the words

And if there's one thing I've learned through the years

It's how to pour my heart out without tears

Without tears

Earth magic

Looking for the lines

But never knowing that stream

Ley line the spring that's always flowing

Spirals up and down then reverse direction

Don't you wonder where the energy goes?

Too many secrets have been told this way

Too many secrets have been given away

But if there's one thing I've learned through the years

It's how to pour my heart out without tears

Without tears

Earth magic
Bring back that lovin' feeling 'cause it's gone gone gone
Woman don't need no run around

Don't need no truth in disguise

She only goes by

that look of love in her eye

There ain't no other side to see

She plays it so easily

and I gotta love her -ah-

when she shows it to me

Oh the woman comes and goes

When the morning comes she goes

Yeah the woman comes,

and goes when she's satisfied

I might not see her for days

Then she bumps in, in a haze

I like how her mind works

and I love how it plays

She gets her kick and she leaves

and leaves me weak in the knees

A bitter smile but

a lot of sweet memories

I like it. I love it...
The light from your star is glowing

Yeah, I see you in the magazine

Your face seems older now, more knowing

But I prefer a woman to a teenage queen

The wine and the confusion

It's your game and you play it so cool

That night seems like an illusion

In your hotel room

German eyes, blonde disguise







Never really knew who I was talking to

But if you're supposed to be such a mystery

Why was it so easy for me to be with you

Why was it so easy for me to be with you

Too much time has come between us

And the sad words that I hear you say

Must mean you don't hold me inside you

But I guess it couldn't go any other way

That night is so far behind us

The words are changed and so is the time

I only hope that you think of me

In a hotel room

Oh those eyes, blonde disguise

Never really knew who I was talking to

But if you're supposed to be such a mystery

Why was it so easy for me to be with you

Why was it so easy for me to be with you
You burn me up I'm a cigarette
You hold my hand I begin to sweat
You make me nervous
Ooh I'm nervous
It must be real bad karma
For this to be my dharma
With you 

You burn me up I'm a cigarette
Life with you is a loser's bet
You make me crazy
Ooh I'm going crazy
Your therapeutic antics
Well they really make me frantic
With you 

Strategic interaction irreducible fraction
Terminal inaction and a bitter hostile faction
I'm getting anxious
I'm franxious
Transactional diseases are the only thing that pleases
Us 

You burn me up I'm a cigarette
Demanding my attention which you're not gonna get
What did the sage mean?
What had the sage seen?
Musical elation is my only consolation
Oh yeah 

You burn me up I'm about to ignite
When you tell me you love me I give up this fight
I'm feeling put down my feelings shut down
I want rejuvenation from male emancipation 

Strategic interaction terminal inaction
A bitter hostile faction irreducible fraction
Transactional diseases are the only thing that pleases
Fall In Philadelphia

There's a thunder storm 'a brewin'
And the day is turning gray
There ain't much to say about the weather
The shower stall is leakin'
And the ceiling's fallin' in
And I'm getting twenty bills to every letter

I've got to move myself out to the country
I'm lookin' out for any place at all
I'm gonna spend another Fall In Philadelphia

A roving band of youths beat up on Johnny
Everybody's gettin' richer sellin' that dope
Say, the stolen bikes are gathering by the thousands
Along with seven million people without a hope

I guess I have to face the fact as real
I think I feel my back up against the wall
I'm gonna spend another Fall In Philadelphia 

Las Vegas Turnaround The Stewardess Song

Sara's off on a turnaround
Flying gambling fools to the holy land, Las Vegas
Sometimes she's home and sometimes she can't be found,
Turnaround

Sara's off, half hiding, far above the clouds, high she flies
I know I've got to find her a place she can push her toes around in
She needs a place where she can lounge and wear a gown in
Sara turnaround turnaround

And any night she's here or half way 'round the world, oh I could
Cry
So I know I've got to pray for delays and for days 'til she's besides
Me
All alone in her room and her scattered clothes remind me
Sara please
Sara

Everybody's high on consolation
Everybody's trying to tell me
What is right for me, yeah
I need a drink and a quick decision
Now it's up to me, ooooh what will be


She's gone, she's gone
Oh, why
Oh, why
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, she's gone
Oh, why
Oh, why
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, she's gone
Oh, why
What went wrong

Get up in the morning, look in the mirror
One less tooth brush hanging in the stand
My face ain't looking any younger
Now what I can see
Love's taken a toll on me
She's gone, she's gone
Oh, why
Oh, why
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, she's gone
Oh, why
Oh, why
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, she's gone
Oh, why
What went wrong

Think I'll spend eternity in the city
Let the carbon and monoxide choke my thoughts away
And pretty bodies help dissolve the memories
There can never be what she once was to me
She's gone, she's gone
Oh, why
Oh, why
I better learn how to face it
She's gone, she's gone
Oh, why
Oh, why
I'd pay the devil to replace her
She's gone, she's gone

You're Much Too Soon

Can't find the reason to stay with you
And by now a reason should appear
Anybody else could understand my fear
That, You're Much Too Soon
Much too much
You're much too much, too soon
You're Much Too Soon
Don't think I'm blown away, by what I am
It's just a job, that keeps me traveling
One thing I've learned is how to take my time
You're Much Too Soon

You've only known me for a week

All comes down to that same old thing
That I love you
But, I don't love you
I love you

Can't Stop The Music

He's the star of the stage, and he screams all night
'Cause he can't get to sleep at all
And his favorite book, by the T.V. light, can't stop the matinee,
He's played it over and over
He Can't Stop The Music, or remember the ending to his song
He played it much too long
All those hard-earned words, that he's fought from his pen
Have been forgotten in some empty hall
And the wide-eyed looks, on those wiped-out faces
Make some dreams in such places over and over
He Can't Stop The Music, or remember the ending to his song
He played it much too long
Wouldn't believe your ears, if he told you what the papers use to say
But that was in his hey-day
Back in his prime he had the fans in line
You should have seen him then, now look at him
His hair is getting thin
There's one last show before the glory ends
There in the wings, waits his only friend,
The record that he prayed to over and over
He Can't Stop The Music, or remember the ending to his song
He played it much too long
Then we go like this, and we go like that music
Then we go like this, and we go like that,
Can't Stop The Music
Then we go like this, and we go like that music
Then we go like this and we go like that.

Waterwheel

I hear you call me, Waterwheel
Spin round, round in a circle
Gracing my child dreams on fantasy hill
Spin round, round in a circle
Flash! paddles sending a spray to the air
Lately, my thoughts are still-
With you there as you spin round,
Round in a boyhood daydream
Spin round

My thoughts are drifting to a quieter time
Spin round, round in a circle
Green covered slippery water-rocks I used to climb
Spin round, round in a circle
Father and child walking down by the canyon
Lately, my thoughts are still-
With them there as they spin round,
Round in a boyhood daydream
Spin round 
Camellia

Opening night, nothing new Atlanta
Into the spotlight, one more time
Just in time to play
To one man and an empty table
He was drinking down the pain
All he could say was this lady's name...

Oh Camellia won't you take me away

After the show, when the room was empty
No, he wouldn't go
So I asked him why he called her name
It seems she was some magic one night
With something for his pain
But all she left was a pretty name...

Oh Camellia won't you take me away
To paradise tropical moon
Don't you leave me sitting here in Atlanta

Sara Smile

Baby hair with a woman's eyes
I can feel you watching in the night
All alone with me and we're waiting for the sunlight

When I feel cold, you warm me
And when I feel I can't go on, you come and hold me
It's you and me forever

Sara, smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile for me, Sara?

If you feel like leaving you know you can go
But why don't you stay until tomorrow?
And if you want to be free
You know all you got to do is say so

When you feel cold, I'll warm you
And when you feel you can't go on, I'll come and hold you
It's you and me forever

Sara, smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile for me, Sara?
Sara, smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile, Sara?

Smile
Oh, won't you smile awhile for me, Sara?
Oh, smile awhile
Won't you laugh, Sara?
Thank you for making me feel like a man
Keeping me crazy, crazy
Smile awhile

Out Of Me, Out Of You

I need you more than anyone else in the world
But what you need more than me is the help I can give to you girl
That's what you need
You can make it happen
I can show you the way, and help you to say
What you're feeling inside
Lower your shield is it's real and you feel it

Then what can come out of me
Can come out of you
The love that comes from me
Can come out of you

Can't you see that this game that you're playing with me
Is holding you back
Black or white? Shades of gray are more like it you know
So let yourself go
You can make it happen
I can show you the way, and help you to say
What you're feeling inside
Lower your shield is it's real and you feel it

Then what can come out of me
Can come out of you
The love that comes from me
Can come out of you

Gino The Manager

You've got Sicilian imagination
Second generation
And a long way from the family crime
But you've got your own way
Sign on the line, sign on the line, on the line

You're a patent leather lover
With you're Gucci-Pucci pointed shoes
And you're swearing on your mother
That all this could be yours
Sign on the line, sign on the line, on the line

Remember hard work means something
Live fast, die laughing
No hurt in asking
Nothing for nothing

Gino no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no!

You've got Contractual Agitation
Transcendental meditation works fine
But now you're paying off the Guru
Get to Heaven on time
Sign on the line, sign on the line, on the line

Remember hard work means something
Live fast, die laughing
No hurt in asking
Nothing for nothing

You couldn't live without little Gino, no
That's what he tells me, little Gino, no
You couldn't live without little Gino, no
That's what he tells me, little Gino, no no 

Ennui On The Mountain

We don't need a whole lot of money
We don't need a Cadillac car
What we need is a mountain in Montana
A thousand acre world for the roadies and the girls
But you need a whole lot of money
Lots of loot, to tell you the troot'
Oh, we know what's good but we love what's bad
And it'd be ennui on the mountain anyway
Oh I don't know if it's high or low
But it's round and round and round and round we go
I don't know what I need

Everyday we try to get higher
Any way to the dream at the end
AM airplay and a golden concept album
So they pay for what you say
And they hang on every word
You and me are just Ponce de Leon-y
Looking for something we ain't never gonna find
Oh, we know what's good but we love what's bad
And it'd be ennui on the mountain anyway
Oh I don't know if it's high or low
But it's round and round and round and round we go

Rich Girl

You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch girl but it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money but it won't get you too far
Get you too far

Don't you know, don't you know
That it's wrong to take what is given you
So far gone, on your own
You can get along if you try to be strong
But you'll never be strong 'cause

You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch girl and it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money but it won't get you too far
Get you too far

High and dry, out of the rain
It's so easy to hurt others when you can't feel pain
And don't you know that a love can't grow
'Cause there's too much to give, 'cause you'd rather live
For the thrill of it all, oh

You're a rich girl, and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch girl and it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money but it won't get you too far
Say money but it won't get you too far
Say money but it won't get you too far
Get you too far

And you say
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money

Crazy Eyes

Pardon the crazy way I behave
And the things I say
Maybe I'm too young to know the score
But there's something inside not right
Wish I could vocalize
If I screamed would you realize
Feeling like a child without his toys
But just want to tell you...


Everything's all right
I'm just looking at you through
Crazy eyes toniqht
So if I'm acting kind of strange
I'm just looking through crazy eyes

Cloudy day say it looks like rain
What's the use, I know it's all the same
Read a magazine, electric light
Is keeping me from my dreams
How do I sound to you?
Like a fool, a little cuckoo too
I only wish I know what I should do
Believe me when tell you

Everything's all right
I'm just looking at you through
Crazy eyes toniqht
So if I'm acting kind of strange
I'm just looking through crazy eyes

Everything seems to have changed
I don't even know my name
I wish I could place the blame on someone
But there's no one -

Everything's all right
I'm just looking at you through
Crazy eyes toniqht
So if I'm acting kind of strange
I'm just looking through crazy eyes


Do What You Want, Be What You Are

Do what you want girl, but be what you are
There ain't no right er wrong way
Just a play from the heart
It ain't a sign of weakness to give yourself away
Because the strong give up and move on,
While the weak give up and stay

So do what you want to do
But be what you are...

Do you believe in hot cars,
Leather bars, or movie stars
Is that what's real
Payin' dues, Earth Shoes, Chicago blues
Is that how you feel?
You can change, but you can't conceal
What's deep inside you
It's your game, it's your deal


So do what you want to do
But be what you are...
Love Hurts Love Heals

You can say that I lied a lot you can
throw up your hands
Pardon me, if the man you got
wasn't part of the plan
I'll confess, if I'm wrong or not so you'll
know where you stand
Love's a test and you've got to find out
if you're stronger
Then I am
Love Hurts
Love Heals
And it's the only thing that will keep
us together
First we fight, then we fall asleep, then
we wake up as friends
With a kiss and a promise we won't
do it again
Can't you see, when the fighting ends
that nobody wins
Can you tell if we've gone too far
to come back again
Love Hurts
Love Heals
It's the only thing, it's the only thing
Bigger Than Both Of Us

There's a million like us so we're not alone
A million like us tho' I can't think of one
There must be a million people who are
pulling apart
And they don't know how to stop it,
can't stop it when it starts
We can begin with a little bit of
honesty
You can tell the truth when you're
talking to me
And what comes to my mind when I
think of you is....
What am I here for? There must be
something more

[Chorus:]
It's Bigger Than Both of Us
No matter what you say I just can't
think of a way with you
But nothing really lasts forever
Bigger Than Both Of Us
No matter how I try, I can't even
work up a sigh for you
Nothing ever lasts, nothing really
lasts forever

Just think of me as another page
in your life
A curious way for you to pass the time
Just another memory when you're
middle-aged
There's someone for the girl with everything
Secure in the knowing that she ain't
gonna break
You're too much for me I'm too much
for you
So what are you here for when you
know there's something more

[Chorus]

There's a million like us
It's Bigger Than Both of Us
Winged Bull

Well I'm looking at her from a rock &
roll tower
With the windows, its eyes
And its black stained sides that can't
be climbed
cause they're slick as wet glass
And the gate lets the force out, but thru
none shall pass

But when I'm with you it's just me in my time
Guess I've taken some form
Who knows which time around
But one of the reasons is to unite me
with you
I'm sure of that baby, if a heart tells the truth

Is it the Winged Bull
Or the horns of Old Pan
There's Ra unto Isis
There's woman to man
Sun and the moon
Minus and plus
Zero equals two
In love and in us

Wings of fire and me in my time
Taking the form making this sound
It's all of the reasons that unite me with you
I'm sure of that baby
If a heart tells the truth
Heart tells the truth It's A Laugh

You must be thinking something
But you ain't saying nothing
You remember me, I used to be your boyfriend
There ain't no point in reason
It only gets defensive
And why should we ruin the purity of the moment
It's a Laugh
What a laugh
It's so stupid I gotta laugh
And the funny thing is that everyone thought we were special
Maybe I should feel guilty
Is that the American way
But I just look at myself
As if I were above me
You must be thinking something
But you ain't saying nothing
You remember me, I have been here always
I am here forever
I Don't Wanna Lose You

You and I have separate lives girl
You and I go different ways on roads that cross
When love and loss is ruled by fate
People have a tragic habit
Of letting love get in the way
They tend to lose their overviews and overplay
Something I wanna say
Something I've got to do
Feels like you're drifting away
And I don't wanna lose you
I'll try to find a way to encourage you
It's easy to convince myself
Cause I can't believe you'd wanna be with somebody else
People have a tragic habit
Of letting love get in the way
They tend to lose their overviews and overplay
Something I wanna say
Something I've got to do
Feels like you're drifting away
And I don't wanna lose you
Don't Blame It On Love

Mighty high or low down
Change around the words and they say
Low is not the last one
Cause you know, if you know
You'd be learning from a hit lip
Success is sitting fat and limp
But don't blame it on the system
It's only natural only natural
Blame it on yourself
Blame it on me
But don't blame it on love
Who d'ya think your heroes are?
Failures everyone
But you all love them for their innocence
When they fall when they fall
The loser's always deified
Winner only takes home the prize
But don't blame it on the system
It's only natural it's only natural
For you to blame it on yourself
Blame it on me
But don't blame it on love 
Wait For Me

Midnight hour almost over
Time is running out for the magic pair
I know you gave the best that you have
But one more chance
Couldn't be all that hard to bear.

Wait for me please
Wait for me
Alright, I guess
that's more than I should ask
Wait for me please
Wait for me
Although I know the light is fading fast.

You could go either way
Is it easier to stay
I wonder what you'll do
When your chance rolls around
But you gotta know how much I want to keep you
When I'm away I'm afraid it will all fall down.
Love is what it does and ours is doing nothing
But all the time we spent
It must be good for something
Please forgive all the disturbance I'm creating
But you got a lot to learn if you think that I'm not waiting for you. 
All You Want Is Heaven

What's the point of standing
Ten feet tall if you never learn to fall
If you want to win you've got to play the game
But if you lose you must accept the pain
So don't reach for the sky if
All you want is heaven.
Reason makes us human
But love makes us believe we can conquer all
I ask for fire and you give me rain
I ask for nothing and you give the same
And I'd give you the sky but
All you want is heaven. 
			
Who Said The World Was Fair

If there's enough to go around why can't I get mine
If everybody knows they've been lied to
If everybody knows it, then why are they waiting
On a gas line
I think it must be a test to weed the best from the rest
But whatever they are doing is driving us
Out of our minds
Driving us out of our minds
But we always take it 'cause

Who said the world was fair
or that we should care
What a way of thinking

The sun is free enough
It's shining there, shining there out of our reach
But if they can, they'll find a way
To make us pay for what we get
When we lay out on the beach
Bebop / Drop

3 A.M.
I don't believe I hear the telephone ring
I wanna sleep
you wanna shake that thang
I wanna dream
you wanna dance all night

If I knew
if I knew you and better we could fight about it
You just wanna Bebob but I just wanna Drop
Don't call me
because your boyfriend isn't home tonight
Don't pretend
cause out of mind is only out of sight
It's much too late
look and see how quick the candle burns
Go away
go away and let my dreams return
You just wanna Bebop but I just wanna Drop 
Kiss On My List

My friends wonder why
I call you all of the time
What can I say
I don't feel the need
To give such secrets away
You think maybe I need help
No, I know that I'm right
I'm just better off
Not listening to friends' advice
When they insist on knowing my bliss
I tell them this
When they want to know
What the reason is
I only smile when I lie
Then I tell them why

Because your kiss your kiss
Is on my list
Because your kiss your kiss
Is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list
Of the best things in life
Because your kiss your kiss
Is on my list
Because your kiss your kiss
I can't resist
Because your kiss is on my list
When I turn out the light

I go crazy wondering
What there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time
'Cos it means more to me
Sometimes I forget what I'm doing
I don't forget what I want
Regret what I've done
Regret you
I couldn't go on
And if you insist
On knowing my bliss
I'll tell you this
If you want to know
What the reason is
I'll only smile when I lie
Then I'll tell you why

Because your kiss your kiss
Is on my list
Because your kiss your kiss
I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss
When I turn out the light

[Instrumental Interlude]

Listen, girl

Because your kiss your kiss
Is on my list
Because your kiss your kiss
Is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list
Of the best things in life
Oh, man Because your kiss your kiss
Is on my list
Because your kiss your kiss
I can't resist
Because your kiss is on my list
Of the best things in life 
			
Big Kids

Got a good education now
And I'm ready for the world yeah
We've been going together
It's gonna last forever, it ain't never gonna change
I'm a real hard charger yeah
Everybody's gonna listen to me
We're a winning combination, that nobody's gonna rearrange

Big Kids breakin' up 'cause they're lookin' for fun
Everybody's leavin', boy-girl on the run
My situation's static, there's no reason to fear
It's too calm around me and it can't happen here

Big Kids - think they know it all
Big Kids - think they've got the world up against the wall
All the grown-ups show me that they're only Big Kids in disguise
Who do you think your leaders are? Big Kids
Who do you think your heroes are? Big Kids
I may never reach maturity but, baby, I'm gonna try 
How Does It Feel To Be Back

Please return, come back, I've been saving your place
Too much time has elapsed-unreality-memory erases
The rules and the rights and the wrongs don't apply
Far apart - So together is destiny weeded to fate
I write the script, you direct my dreams
We're along on the beach for the passionate scene
And it's a drag to wake up with you ... saying to me
How does it feel to be back in my arms again

I'm bored and alone and it's weakening me
One night out and I'm looking for trouble and finding it's easy
You know we all make mistakes and we all need the touch of a hand
In the right kind of place, in a time of need
I could pick up the phone, but the talk ain't cheap
I pick up on the thoughts that you're sending to me
And i wait for the day I hear you saying to me
How does it feel to be back in my arms again

		
Gotta Lotta Nerve Perfect Perfect

Oh, no, stop bitching indiscretion
You're such an A-1 lover, since when are you perfection
Never true blue to me, so why are you getting nasty
Well, it's lucky for you that I'm gonna keep dancing
Oh, I know

Everyone you do is perfect
Everyone you know is perfect
Everywhere you go is perfect
So on and so on

But you've gotta lotta nerve when you talk about love
If you've gotta lotta nerve we can talk about love
Oh, you've gotta lotta nerve to be talking about love
Yeah, you gotta lotta nerve 'til we talk about love

Listen to you ... your roots will be showing
Better watch what you say and do
Or da cool you'll be blowing
We're talking 16 tones of nerve-a
We're talking perfect nerve 
You Make My Dreams

What I want you've got
And it might be hard to handle
Like the flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame, yeah, yeah

Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
Then you pull them all together
And how I can't explain
Oh, yeah

On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with the dreamer

Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cos I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same
Oh, yeah
Well, 'cos you
Ooh-ho, hoo-ooh, ooh-oo

Mano A Mano

See a lot of people walking around and around
Terra firma turned them upside down
Too scared to reach out maybe afraid of what they'll find
But a hand stuck in a pocket come up empty every time
Now you better believe the writing on the wall
All for one one for all
Woman to woman and man to man
Face to face heart to heart hand to hand

Mano a Mano
Hand to Hand
Mano a Mann

See a lot of people fighting for the left or the right
Fighting people see black or white
You'd like to go your way sure I'd like to go mine
But we're all in this together running out of time
Woman to woman and man to man
Heart to heart and hand to hand
Set on example for all the little boys and girls
For the hand that rocks the cradle can rule the world

Mano a Mano
Hand to Hand

Did It In A Minute

When you find yourself alone
And when going out is coming home
Well, you can count on the kid
'Cause there's nobody waiting around
Oh-oh, if you're not an easy mark
It's a shot in the dark that hits the heart
And I know, I know, I know, I know
When it's coming
I thought so anyway
Some things stay the same
And some are due for change
I thought I had them all nailed down
But you turned it around

Oh you did it
You did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute
You did it
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know you did it
You did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute
You did it

Well I still can't say I know
When a love is real or touch and go
And if two can be one
Who is the one two becomes, oh-oh
Am I quick enough to see
When I'm ready and it's right for me
I say, I say, I say, I say that I want it
I think so anyway
Everybody always laughs at love
But what they want is to be proven wrong
Then you came along

Oh you did it
You did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute
You did it
I know, I know, I know, I know
Oh-ooooh-oh
You did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute
You did it, you did it, you did it
You did it in a minute
You did it

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know you did it, you did it, you did it
You did it, you did it in a minute
You did it
I didn't really plan it
But you did it, you did it, you did it
You did it, you did it in a minute

I want someone to prove I'm wrong
You did it, you did it, you did it

Your Imagination

I remember when I used to be the jealous kind
I got over it, now you're taking over my old line

You're caring too much about what I say
You're wondering too much about what I do
And baby, Your Imagination
Imagination's got the best of you

I ain't doin' nothing that you could really say was wrong
Just one oversight and no that didn't last too long

Listen, you're caring too much about what I say
You're wondering too much about what I do
And baby, Your Imagination
Imagination's got the best of you

Don't know what you're looking for
What's this thing about true blue
You know I ain't no danger boy
You're the one I like to touch, touch you, you
When the mood is right, change the light and the moment's gone
Better turn around, `cause the light doesn't last too long

You're caring too much about what I say
You're wondering too much about what I do
And baby, Your Imagination
Imagination's got the best of you
Imagination, Your Imagination
Imagination, Use Your Imagination.

Friday Let Me Down

Dial your number
Tape reply:
I'm not at home right now, but leave your name
And I will call you Friday Night. Call you Friday good bye.
Hearing you and waiting make the days drag slowly
On the phone, oh no the tape again
Don't say not at home, no way

Friday let me down tonight

Weekend comes I try again
I hear the same recording
Hasn't changed
I'm not at home right now. Leave your name and I will call you.

Friday let me down tonight.
Maneater

She'll only come out at nights
The lean and hungry type
Nothing is new
I've seen her here before
Watching and waiting
Ooh, she's sittin' with you
But her eyes are on the door

So many have paid to see
What you think
You're gettin' for free
The woman is wild
A she-cat tamed
By the purr of a Jaguar
Money's the matter
If you're in it for love
You ain't gonna get too far

Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater
Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater

I wouldn't if I were you
I know what she can do
She's deadly man
And she could really rip your world apart
Mind over matter
Ooh, the beauty is there
But a beast is in the heart

Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater
Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater

[Instrumental Interlude]

Ooooooooh
Oh-oh, here she comes
Here she comes
Watch out boy
She'll chew you up
Whoa-oh, here she comes
Watch out she's a maneater
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater
Ooh, she'll chew you up
Oh-oh, here she comes
Here she comes, she's a maneater
Oh-oh, here she comes
Watch out
She'll only come out at night, ooh-oh
Oh-oh, here she comes
Here she comes
She's a maneater
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater
The woman is wild, whoooa
Oh-oh, here she comes
Here she comes
Watch out boy, watch out boy
Oh-oh, here she comes
Oh, watch out, watch out
Watch out, watch out
Oh-oh, here she comes
Yeah, yeah she's a maneater
Oh-oh, here she comes
She's a maneater
She's watching and waiting, ooh-oh
Oh-oh, here she comes
Oh, she's a maneater

Crime Pays

I know you know all the pros and cons
They help you get to everything you want
Greasing policemen bending all the rules
Make them an offer that they can't refuse
One crime baby I can't forgive
The kind that hurts where I live
I'm a nice guy I try to wait and see
If you'll get caught or go free

You stole my heart and left me blue
It look like crime pays for you
You do it and you get away
It seem like crime pays
Crime pays

Beat the heat but you couldn't pay me off
You're staying cool no matter what it costs
You get caught you'll never do the time
I have to say you've got a way with one crime baby I can't forgive
The kind that hurts where I live
It's all too clear but I still don't see
Why all the guilty go free

You stole my heart and left me blue
It look like crime pays for you
You do it and you get away
It seems like crime pays
Crime pays
It seems like crime pays
Crime pays

Catch a thief and let her go
You won't get back the love she stole
Shake her down but she don't mind
'Cause she commit the perfect crime OK, OK
You know I know you're a pro and con artiste
Oh baby you're a false alarm
Why do I try to play it by the rules
I was the victim but I'm not a fool

You stole my heart and left me blue
It looks like crime pays for you
You do it and you get away
It seems like crime pays

One On One

I'm tired of playing on the team
Ooooh, it seems I don't get time out anymore
What a change if we set the pace face to face
No one even trying to score
And oh, oh, I can feel the magic of your touch
Umm-humm, And when you move in close
A little bit means so much
And ooh yeah, you've got to understand, baby
Time out is what I'm here for

Whoooa, one on one
I wanna play that game tonight
One on one I know
I wanna play that one on one
I wanna play that game tonight
One on one so slow
Ooooooh-oh

Oooooh, you can't tell me you don't miss me girl
I think I might know you too well, whooooa
I wonder what you'd say if you knew
That I was coming tonight
Want to
I want you can't you tell

Ooooh, whoooa, one on one
I wanna play that game tonight
One on one I know
I wanna play that one on one
I wanna play that game tonight
One on one so slow
Ooooooh-oh
That's all you need to know now

[Instrumental Interlude]

'Cause if it's really right
There's nothing else
One on one
I wanna play that game tonight
Ooooh-oh mmmmmmm
One on one
I wanna play that game tonight
One on one
Ooooooh-oh

I wanna play that game tonight
One on one I wanna play that game tonight
Ooooooh-oh

One on one on one on one, girl
On one ooooooh, there's nothing else
On one but you and me on one
I want no one else on one
I don't want no one else on one
Oh, baby, I'm tired of playing on one
I'm tired of playing on one
I don't want to play those games no more...

Family Man

She had sulky smile
She took her standard pose
As she presented herself
She had sultry eyes
She made it perfectly plain
That she was his for a price

But he said, leave me alone
I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse
Than my bite
He said, leave me alone
I'm a family man
But if you push me too far
I just might

She wore hurt surprise
As she rechecked her make-up
To protect herself
Dropped her price and pride
She made it totally clear
That she was his for a night

But he said leave me alone
I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse
Than my bite
He said leave me alone
I'm a family man
But if you push me too far
I just might

She gave him her look
It would've worked
On any other man around
He looked her up and down
She knew he couldn't decide
If he should hold his ground

But he said leave me alone
I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse
Than my bite
He said leave me alone
I'm a family man
But if you push me too far
I just might

She turned, tossed her head
Unlike her opening move
Her final exit line
He waited much too long
But by the time he got his courage up
She was gone

Then he screamed leave me alone
I'm a family man
And my bark
Is much worse than my bite
He said leave me alone
I'm a family man
But if you push me too far
I just might

He said leave me alone
I'm a family man
And I don't think I want tonight
And he said leave me alone
I'm a family man
But if you push me too far
I just might
He said leave me alone
I'm a family man
And my bark is much worse
Than my bite
He said leave me alone
I'm a family man
If you push me too far
I just might
He said leave me alone
I'm a family man
Leave me alone
'Cause I've got to go home

I see I see I see the greatest works of art in western civilization

They're keeping ya
Faccia bella cara mia
Somebody tell me where are the Italian girls


Go Solo

You need to make it on your own
You wanna shake it go it alone
Whatever happened?
I did alright by you
I can feel the passion girl

Though the places have turned around
Oh I can be the one to wait

Play a brand new part
Go Solo, solo

You say there's trouble in Paradise
I'm only joking but you better be right
Oh, whatever happens, there ain't no turnin' 'round

To take the only way out

Ain't enough for you
Go Solo

Play a brand new part
Go Solo, solo

I don't mind your flying blind
Just shake it up and take it to the break this time

All American Girl

Skin tight soul delight
Changing her life for another
She dreams magazines
Sees herself on the cover
Anything anytime anywhere
It's fitting in that matters
Faithfully she believes in the look he wants to know better

She knows what she wants
She's an all American girl
She knows what she needs
She's a sold American girl
She knows what she knows
She's an all American girl
She does what she does
She's an all American girl
Sold American

She's got a Double Bubble with a bossanova back
She's a real hot pepper and I like it like that
It's all right you don't have to change your way
You're all right I'm hoping the best part stays

She knows what she wants
She's an all American girl
She knows what she needs
She's a sold American girl
She knows what she knows
She's an all American girl
She does what she does
She's an all American girl
Sold American

Possession Obsession

You know there's something you need
Right here and now
To fill the space inside of yourself
Money love or power
When you want to have the number one first run anyone
You're crazy 'til you own them
You ought to know better than that
The more that you buy the less you get back
It's a case of possession obsession
Gimme Gimme

The compulsion to count the percentage of time
Spent between two lovers
Can turn an hour into a crime
And all the good times suffer
Though you know it's only jealousy
You can't help but be
Haunted by your passion
Don't you know it's a matter of fact
The more that you take the less you give back
Just a taste of possession obsession
Brings a case of possession obsession
Gimme Gimme 
Some Things Are Better Left Unsaid

I feel like I could run away
Looking at a darker day
Oh I'm pulling the shades away from my eyes
It's true the moody manners come and go
And it's better that you never know

Some things are better left unsaid
Some strings are better left undone
Some hearts are better left unbroken
Some lives are better left untouched
Some lies are better off believed
Some words are better left unspoken

My ideas seem to frighten you
Are you really that afraid to move
Oh I guess that it's your right to reason
I'm still dealing with a force that's so strong
The force is stringing us along

Method Of Modern Love

In the moonlite
Under startlite
Songs old as the night are what I've been dreaming of
Everybody's hard as iron
Locked in a modern world
Dreams are make of a different stuff

I believe love will always be the same
Ways and means are the parts subject to change
M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's a method of modern love

I can call you
Got your number
Share my life with you a thousand miles away
If you've hurt me
I haven't shown it
Time's too tight to fight
And we're never face to face
Style is timeless and fashion's only now
We've got the ways no one needs to show us how 
Adult Education

Afternoon in the homeroom
They're about to let you go
And the locker slam
On the plan you had tonight
You've been messin' around with a boyfriend
Maybe better left alone
There's a wise guy that you know
Could put you right
In the lot the boy that's idling by
Doesn't rev your heart
'Cause it's only lonely spots
He shares with you
And long halls and the gray walls
Are gonna split apart
Believe it or not
There's life after high school

And that's why
The student body got a bad reputation
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
What they need is adult education
Back to school it's a bad situation
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
What you want is an adult education

Oh, yeah
The teacher don't know about how to deal
With the student body huh, huh
And the underclassmen are flashing
Hot and cool huh, huh
But your girlfriends care
About watch and wear
And talkin about it huh, huh
Believe it or not
There's life after high school huh, huh
That's right

The student body got a bad reputation
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
What they need is adult education
You go back to school
It's a bad situation
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
What you want is an adult education
Oh, yeah

They're calling it preparation huh, huh
You're waiting for a separation
You're nothing but another odd number huh, huh
Memories that you won't remember
So you got a little education huh, huh
And a lot of dedication
But you want a little night school huh, huh
Maybe some of it'll rub off on ya
The boys are busy in the mirrors huh, huh
Trying to imitate their heroes
You make it with a false surrender huh, huh
More memories you won't remember
The senior with the Junior Miss huh, huh
I wonder what the junior wishes
That she could graduate to adult huh, huh
That she could graduate to adult kisses

Say It Isn't So

Say it
Say it isn't so
Say it
Say it isn't so

Say it isn't so painful
To tell me that you're dissatisfied
Last time I asked you
I really got a bad excuse
I know that you lied
Now wicked things can happen
You see 'em goin' down in war
But when you play in a quiet way
That bites it even more
Say it
Tell me what you want, yeah
I'll do it, baby
I promise right now
Say it
Who propped you up
When you were stopped low motivation
had you on the ground
I know your first reaction
You slide away
Hide away, goodbye
But if there's a doubt
Maybe I can give out
A thousand reasons why
You have to say it isn't so
It isn't so
I say it isn't so it isn't so
Oh, no
I say it isn't so it isn't so
Oh, say it isn't so it isn't so
Oh-oh, no
Say it
We like to be the strangers
At the party
Two rebels in a shell say it
You like to move
With the best of them
You know we move so well
Don't need someone to lean on
I know where there's an open door
But if I'm faced
With being replaced
I want you even more
So baby, say it isn't so it isn't so
Oh-oh, say it isn't so it isn't so
