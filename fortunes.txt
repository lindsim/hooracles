Nothing ever lasts, nothing really lasts forever
Black or white? Shades of gray are more like it you know
Like the flame that burns the candle the candle feeds the flame
When the mood is right change the light and the moment's gone
The old songs never end gives you something to believe in
Electric light is keeping me from my dreams
Everybody always laughs at love but what they want is to be proven wrong
The strong give up and move on while the weak give up and stay
Do what you want to do but be what you are
Don't hold back your love
If you're in it for love you ain't gonna get too far
The more that you take the less you give back
It's so easy to hurt others when you can't feel pain
